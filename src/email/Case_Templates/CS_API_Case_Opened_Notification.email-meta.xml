    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact} {!Case.Lead__c},



Thanks for reaching out for help with the BigCommerce API. We’ll get back to you as soon as possible. In case you need to talk to anyone about this issue, your Ticket Number is {!Case.CaseNumber}.



Please note: In order to improve our service and tracking of submitted issues, we are currently providing troubleshooting support for the API via our support portal. The next time you submit an API ticket, please visit support.bigcommerce.com and choose API from the dropdown menu.



If your support request is for help with one of the apps in our App Store, please contact the app developer directly.



If you’re an app developer looking for API help, you can submit your ticket using your sandbox store.



We’ll be shutting down this email address on June 1, 2014.



Thanks!



The BigCommerce Support Team
