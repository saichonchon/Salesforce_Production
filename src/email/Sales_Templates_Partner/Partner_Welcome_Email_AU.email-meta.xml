    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Over the last couple of months, we’ve worked hard to put together a new Partner Program that benefits both our design/development partners and their clients, so we can continue to work with some of the best web professionals in the world.

I’m very happy to welcome you to the program as a BigCommerce Partner.

Being a BigCommerce Partner gives you great benefits like:

Co-marketing materials, including a BigCommerce Partner logo you can use on your site (attached to this email)
An assigned Partner Development Executive
New commission options
Social media materials
Potential placement in our online Partners Directory — please ask how you can be featured

Don&apos;t forget to log in to your Partner Portal for updated marketing materials like web content and emails. If you need help logging in, please call 1-888-699-8911, option 4.

We look forward to continuing our relationship together as we both grow in 2013 and beyond.

Thank you and congratulations!
