    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

My name is Robbie, and I’m on the Client Development Team at Bigcommerce. We work with online merchants to help them get started on Bigcommerce and make sure they’re ready for success. I thought you might be interested in some of the many new features we’ve released like mobile optimization, blogging, new payments integrations and a lot more. 

When would be a good time for a 5-minute call to go over your goals or feedback about Bigcommerce? You can reply to let me know, or call me directly at (512) 865-4597 x4597.

If you’d like to sign up for another free trial to check out the new features, you can do that here - http://www.bigcommerce.com/p/12157.html

&quot;Since switching, we have seen a 30% increase in conversion rates and revenue has doubled.&quot; — Jennifer Untermeyer, travelkiddy.com

“Bigcommerce gives us powerful e-commerce features, a useful app library and a great support team who are always there when we have questions.” — Valerie Hornsby, homeinspired.co.uk


Thanks in advance for your time!</textOnly>
