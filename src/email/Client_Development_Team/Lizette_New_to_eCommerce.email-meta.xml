    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

My name is Lizette, and I’m on the Client Development Team at Bigcommerce. We work with online merchants to help them get started on Bigcommerce and make sure they’re ready for success. Looks like you signed up for a trial with us a few months ago, but decided not to move forward. We’ve recently released a ton of new features that I think will help you, including beautiful free themes that are mobile optimized.

When would be a good time for a 5-minute call to go over your goals or feedback about Bigcommerce? You can reply to let me know, or call me directly at +1-512-865-4504.

If you’d like to sign up for another free trial to check out the new features, you can do that here - http://www.bigcommerce.com/p/12876.html

Here’s what a couple of Bigcommerce merchants have to say about us:

&quot;Bigcommerce has provided us with a feature-rich platform that allowed us to quickly scale our business.&quot; — Daniel Rensing, thesmartbaker.com

&quot;We started with Bigcommerce and our business has grown by leaps and bounds.&quot; — Marcia Bacon, goodnighties.com

Thanks in advance for your time!

Sincerely,
Lizette Flores
Client Development Consultant
