Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your  patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue was causing all products in orders shipped internationally to be combined to a single line item which would incorrectly quote value and weight on customs forms for international shipping labels printed using the USPS by Endicia shipping module. This issue has been resolved such that now items are listed individually, weights are listed for each line item on a per unit basis and the values are aggregated to match the behavior of the USPS customs form wizard at https://cns.usps.com/cfo/ShippingInformationAction!input.action
