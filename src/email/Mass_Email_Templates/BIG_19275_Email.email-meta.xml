Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your patience has been truly appreciated. Recently you experienced an issue that caused order discounts for a dollar amount off to change to a percent off discount when saved. This issue is now resolved. Affected discount rules may need to be edited and re-saved to properly discount a dollar amount instead of a percentage.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
