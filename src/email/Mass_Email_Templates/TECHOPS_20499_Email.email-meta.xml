Hello,

We wanted to update you on an issue you recently experienced with your BigCommerce email accounts. Updating to Mozilla Thunderbird v45 caused the following issues:

- New email accounts could not be set up on Thunderbird v45.
- Email accounts already set up on Thunderbird prior to the update could no longer receive emails.

The issue causing both symptoms above has been resolved. Thank you for your patience as worked to fix the problem. Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
