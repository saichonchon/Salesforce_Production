Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue was causing breadcrumbs on product pages to display the top categories instead of the path the shopper took to reach the product page if the product belongs to multiple categories. This issue has now been resolved and the breadcrumbs on product pages now show the category that the shopper used to reach the product page.
