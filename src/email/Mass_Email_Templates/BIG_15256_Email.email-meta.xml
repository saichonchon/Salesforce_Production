Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your  patience has been truly appreciated. Recently, you were affected by an issue that caused the UPS Online Tools shipping quote integration to provide quotes for all products as if they were purchased in quantities of one regardless of the actual quantity while using &quot;Separate&quot; for the Package Dimensions setting. This issue has now been resolved and quantities greater than one are calculating properly when using the &quot;Separate&quot; option for Package Dimensions.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
