Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your  patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue was redirecting clients to the dashboard or their control panel when clicking Products &gt; Import Products in the beta version of the new control panel. This issue has been resolved and all merchants using the new control panel should be able to access the Import Products page normally.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us 24hrs a day if you have any other questions or concerns: https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact.php
