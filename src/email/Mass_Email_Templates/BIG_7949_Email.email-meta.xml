Hello,

In the past, you have tried to import product options with a value of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;00&quot; via a CSV file. For example, a piece of clothing with a size of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;00&quot;. Unfortunately, at that time, you received a &quot;bad data&quot; message from the control panel. Instead, you had to create and update these values manually. 

We are please to inform you that you are able to import product options with &quot;0&quot; values using a CSV file now. This will make it easier for you to update inventory for existing &quot;0&quot; sizes. You will also be able to create &quot;0&quot; size product options from a CSV.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
