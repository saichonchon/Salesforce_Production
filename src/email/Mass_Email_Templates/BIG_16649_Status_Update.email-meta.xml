Hello,

Recently, you contacted support regarding an issue caused by a failure of our storage system to retrieve a template file. This can result in portions of the site not being visible or not functioning at all.

Our engineers have eliminated some errors causing this behavior but not all. We are currently working closely with our storage vendor to completely resolve this issue as soon as possible. Updates are being posted to http://status.bigcommerce.com/ as they become available. Once we have confirmed the issue is completely resolved, the status page will be updated to reflect this.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
