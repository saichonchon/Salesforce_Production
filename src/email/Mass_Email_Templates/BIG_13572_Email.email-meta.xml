Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your patience has been truly appreciated. There was a known issue that allowed shipping labels to be printed for domestic shipping services when an order contained an international shipping address if the postal code corresponds to one within the United States. This issue has been resolved and only international  shipping services/labels can now be used for orders shipping to an international address.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
