Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

After extensive testing, we&apos;ve determined this to be a browser issue with older versions of Chrome and the Android browser.

Chrome 35 (OS X) is broken, Chrome 36+ works. This is occurring specifically for .uk domains which we&apos;ve confirmed via testing on a .uk test store. It seems Chrome refuses to set a cookie on a .uk domain.

Chrome auto-updates itself for most people, so the problem will correct itself for Chrome. With the Android browser (which has much of the same codebase) we&apos;re not so lucky - some people maybe have to wait for an upgrade to their Android OS if they strictly use the built-in browser. Chrome for Android works fine.

I hope I&apos;ve given you some visibility into our efforts to correct this issue - but ultimately it seems the issue exists outside BigCommerce. I&apos;ll keep an ear to the ground for any workarounds that may appear, but it seems your best recourse for the time being is to recommend customers upgrade their browser and/or use Chrome when on Android.

I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience . Let us know if you have further questions.
