 patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue was preventing 
shipments from being created with USPS by Endicia when the recipient's address is in Zip + 4 format. This has been resolved. There is still an issue creating shipments when the "Ship From" address uses Zip + 4 format in Setup and Tools &gt; Shipping. We are currently working with our developers to resolve that issue as well. If you are unable to create shipments or print labels due to the zip code format in Setup and Tools &gt; Shipping, this can be worked around by removing the additional 4 digits from the zip code and using the 5 digit zip code format.<br><div><br></div><div>Please
