Hello,

Your  patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue was preventing shipping labels from being printed when the store&apos;s zip code in Setup and Tools &gt; Shipping was in the Zip + 4 format. We are pleased to announce this has been resolved and shipping labels can now be printed while using the Zip + 4 format in the store&apos;s address.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us 24hrs a day if you have any other questions or concerns: https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact.php
