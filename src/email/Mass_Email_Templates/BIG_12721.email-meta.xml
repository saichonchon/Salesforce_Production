Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue was causing an interaction with certain browsers under certain circumstances that prevented Store Settings from being saved and/or would result in a test email being sent to the store administrator when &quot;Save&quot; was clicked on Store Settings. We are pleased to announce that a change has been released today which resolves this issue.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us 24hrs a day if you have any other questions or concerns: https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact.php
