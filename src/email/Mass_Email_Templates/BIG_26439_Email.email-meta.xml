Hello,

We wanted to send an update on the recent shipping issue you reported to us. Having a flat rate shipping method enabled caused incorrect shipping methods to be applied to a shopper&apos;s order. This issue is now resolved. Be sure to re-enable any flat rate shipping methods you disabled while this issue was occurring.

Our apologies for the inconvenience caused to you and your customers. We truly appreciated your patience while we resolved the issue. Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
