Consequently, an email would be sent to your customer stating the order had been refunded. A fix has been released. <br><br>Going forward, when a PayPal charge is disputed, it will now trigger a new label named "Disputed". This will not send an email to your customer. You will then have the ability to handle the situation as you see fit.<br><br>Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have further questions.
