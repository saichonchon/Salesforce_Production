Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

We are sorry that you were experiencing issues with the page filtering feature not displaying.  The cause was the number of products displayed per page being set to over 100.  By design, that number was limited to 100 - but not documented.  That feature has now been documented in the control panel and appropriate limits/warnings added.  

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
