    <subject>Re: Action Required: complete Stripe application process, impacted payment gateway removed</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},

We have removed your impacted gateway from your store
Per various emails sent and/or phone calls attempted, BigCommerce has streamlined our payments offering to focus on a select number of payment providers. With the August 15, 2016 deadline, we have removed the impacted gateway from your store that we will no longer be supporting. Please see the full list of impacted gateways and additional details on this change.

We have auto-enabled Stripe for payments in your store
To ensure no interruption to your online sales, the BigCommerce team has auto-enabled Stripe in your store to accept credit/debit cards payments.

Complete the Stripe application as soon as possible to continue accepting sales
Your store currently has a temporary account, and it is important to complete the application process immediately to continue accepting sales during the application review process. Please complete the process in the Stripe settings tab in the Payments section of the BigCommerce control panel.

If you need additional assistance to complete this process, please reply to this email for a support specialist to contact you.
