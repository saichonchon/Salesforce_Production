Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your  patience has been truly appreciated. Recently, you were affected by an issue that caused an &quot;Upgrade Now&quot; banner to appear in your store&apos;s control panel. This banner is only intended to display for stores that are currently on a trial and was mistakenly enabled for all stores. This has been corrected and the banner should no longer be displaying in your control panel.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
