Hello,

We wanted to update you on the issues that you experienced while attempting to assign a custom domain to your store.

There was a issue created when we did some internal migrations --- which you experienced first hand when attempting to assign a custom domain to your store.  Our Technical Operations team has resolved the issue, so you should now be able to successfully assign a custom domain to your store.

Here is an article from our knowledge base if you need more information on how to assign it:
