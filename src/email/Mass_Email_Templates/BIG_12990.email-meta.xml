Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your  patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue was preventing shipping labels from being printed from the USPS by Endicia shipping module when letters were present in the store phone number in Setup and Tools &gt; Profile. We are pleased to announce this has been resolved so that now letters can be included in store phone numbers without interfering with shipping labels.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us 24hrs a day if you have any other questions or concerns: https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact.php
