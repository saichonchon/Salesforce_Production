Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Thank you for your patience while our engineers worked to address the issue preventing the primary product image from being displayed on the product page after an image change rule is triggered by choosing an option. We are pleased to announce that this issue has been resolved and default product images now display when options with no image change rules are selected or all options are deselected.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us 24hrs a day if you have any other questions or concerns: https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact.php
