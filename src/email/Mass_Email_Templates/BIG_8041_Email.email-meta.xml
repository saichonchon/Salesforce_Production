Hello,

Your patience has been truly appreciated. Recently, you were affected by a known issue with our blog feature. The &quot;insert links&quot; function on the text editor would not allow you to choose &quot;Open in a New Window&quot;. The issue has been resolved. You should now see a check box next to &quot;Open link in new tab&quot; when inserting links into blog posts.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
