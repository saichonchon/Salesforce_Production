Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your patience has been truly appreciated. Per requests from clients, BigCommerce has implemented changes to BC Analytics to show dollar values with two decimal places. Not all amounts show decimals, such as total revenue where a few cents will not cause a large discrepancy. Amounts like Average Order Value and order totals/subtotals now display to two decimal places.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
