Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your  patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue was preventing shipping labels from being printed for some shipments that contained deleted products. This issue has now been resolved and deleting products after creating a shipment will no longer prevent label printing.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us 24hrs a day if you have any other questions or concerns: https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact.php
