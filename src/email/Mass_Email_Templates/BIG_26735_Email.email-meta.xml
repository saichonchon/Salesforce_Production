Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

We wanted to send an update regarding the recent orders issue you reported to us. Successful orders were arriving in a &quot;Pending&quot; status in the &quot;Incomplete Orders&quot; section of the control panel. Two symptoms accompanied this problem:

 - When an order was placed on the storefront, the finishorder.php page was blank.
 - When a manual order was placed in the control panel, the order did not appear to submit.

The issue has been resolved. Any successful orders that were affected will need to be moved out of the Incomplete Orders section of the control panel. You can do this by simply changing the status of the order to something other than Pending (e.g., Awaiting Fulfillment). Please ensure you&apos;ve received payment before updating an order&apos;s status.  

Our apologies for the inconvenience caused to you and your customers. We truly appreciated your patience while we resolved the issue. Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
