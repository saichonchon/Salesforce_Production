Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your patience has been truly appreciated. Recently you encountered an issue resulting from the FedEx integration requiring the currency used for shipping quotes match the currency used by the &quot;Shipping From&quot; country. We have resolved this by implementing a checkbox to disable the use of package value in quote requests. This checkbox defaults to the &quot;off&quot; setting meaning no package value is sent. By having this setting turned off, the currency is not sent with quote requests and quotes will no longer be rejected due to the currency in use.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
