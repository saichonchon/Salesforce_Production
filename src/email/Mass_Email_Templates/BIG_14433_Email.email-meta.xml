Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your patience has been truly appreciated. Recently, you were affected by an issue regarding disputed PayPal charges. A disputed charge resulted in a customer&apos;s order status changing to &quot;Refunded&quot;. Consequently, an email would be sent to your customer stating the order had been refunded. A fix has been released.

Going forward, when a PayPal charge is disputed, it will now trigger a new label named &quot;Disputed&quot;. This will not send an email to your customer. You will then have the ability to handle the situation as you see fit.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. Technical support is available 24/7:
