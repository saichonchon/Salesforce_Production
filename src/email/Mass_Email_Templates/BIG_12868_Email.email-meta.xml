Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your  patience has truly been appreciated. A known issue with the tax calculation displayed in the cart and in the control panel when using the Automatic Tax feature has been resolved. Previously the Grand Total in the cart and the control panel did not match the sum of the Subtotal, Tax, and Shipping line items. Testing now shows these totals are being calculated correctly.
