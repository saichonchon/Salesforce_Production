Hello,

Your  patience has truly been appreciated. Some changes made to the way contact form emails are handled made earlier this year caused some email programs, such as Gmail, to combine all contact form emails into a single thread. We are pleased to inform you that our engineers have addressed this behavior. Going forward, emails sent by BigCommerce contact form web pages include the customer&apos;s email address and the name of the contact form web page in order to make each customer&apos;s contacts a unique thread.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us 24hrs a day if you have any other questions or concerns: https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact.php
