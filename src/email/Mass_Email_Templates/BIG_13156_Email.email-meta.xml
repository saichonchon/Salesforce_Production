Issue Reported: {!Case.Description}

Hello,

Your   patience has truly been appreciated. Multiple clients have been affected by the deprecation of SSLv3 by Netbilling. We found that we were still using SSLv3 to connect to Netbilling which has been deprecated recently due to the publication of a vulnerability in the protocol. This has now been resolved and BigCommerce is no longer using SSLv3 to connect to Netbilling.

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us 24hrs a day if you have any other questions or concerns: https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact.php
