    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},

We have removed your impacted gateway from your store
Per various emails sent and/or phone calls attempted, BigCommerce has streamlined our payments offering to focus on a select number of payment providers. With the August 15, 2016 deadline, we have removed the impacted gateway from your store that we will no longer be supporting. Please see the full list of impacted gateways and additional details on this change.

You are still accepting sales with your other enabled payment option(s)
We have detected other online payment options enabled in your store, so now all transactions will be processed through those solutions.

Verify your enabled payment options are set up correctly
Please go into the Payments setting area in the BigCommerce control panel to confirm that all enabled payment configurations are set up properly. For more information, please see the following article on connecting a payment gateway. Or, if you need additional assistance to complete this process, please reply to this email for a support specialist to contact you.
