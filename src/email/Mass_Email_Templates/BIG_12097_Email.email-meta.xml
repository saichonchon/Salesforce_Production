Hello,

Thank you for your patience as our development team addressed the ongoing issues with failed transactions due to invalid data being supplied with the transaction while using the new First Data E4 payment gateway. We wanted to let you know a fix for this issue is rolling out right now. If it has not already been applied to your store, it will be overnight and will be in place for the morning of October 8th.
