    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I‘ve tried to contact you a few times but haven’t been able to get a hold of you. I was hoping to talk a little about your business and get you ready to sell.

I’d also like to discuss some of BigCommerce’s coolest features, like the built-in abandoned cart saver that can help you recover up to 15% of lost sales. It’s available on all Gold-level plans and above.

I’m here to help with whatever you need, so please feel free to shoot me an email or call me at {!Lead.OwnerPhone}.
