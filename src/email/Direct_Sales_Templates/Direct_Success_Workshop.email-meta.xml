    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


Now that you’re officially a BigCommerce client, you can attend our 60-minute Success Workshop. An expert from our Success Squad will teach you about everything you need to build a fully functional store, including taxes, shipping, payments, products, a domain name and more.


You’ll also have a chance to ask questions via Twitter during the workshop and see questions from new BigCommerce merchants just like you by using the hashtag #BCSellMore. I’ve attached an agenda so you can see exactly what will be covered.


We hold workshops every Tuesday at 12pm, Wednesday at 5pm and Thursday at 8:30am, all U.S. Central Time. Just let me know when you’d like to attend and I’ll sign you up.


Welcome to BigCommerce!
