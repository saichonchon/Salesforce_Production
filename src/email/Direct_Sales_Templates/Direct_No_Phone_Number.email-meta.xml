    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I’d love to have a quick call to talk about your business and where you want to take it, but it turns out I don’t have a good phone number for you.

When you have a second, can you call me at +1 {!Lead.OwnerPhone} so we can talk?  You can also just email your number and a good time to call and I’ll put it on my calendar.

I promise I won’t ring you up for any late-night chats about politics or philosophy (unless you request it).

Hope to hear from you soon!
