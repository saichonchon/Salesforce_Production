    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Looks like your trial is almost over, which means your store and all its data will be deleted on {!Lead.Trial_Expiration_Date__c}. Please let me know ASAP if you’d like to continue with BigCommerce so I can make sure your store is saved.

If you’d like to keep your BigCommerce store, we have some awesome built-in features you might be interested in, including our abandoned cart saver. It can help you recover up to 15% of lost sales, and is included on Gold-level plans and above.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you need anything, either via email or at {!Lead.OwnerPhone}.
