Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thanks for following up about this - we always appreciate partners who are on top of their commission reporting because it helps us catch issues earlier. 

Due to the 15th falling at the end of the week, there may be an additional processing time for some payments. All payments should be processed by end of business today - please let us know if you don't see your payment come through. 

Best,
Partner Support
