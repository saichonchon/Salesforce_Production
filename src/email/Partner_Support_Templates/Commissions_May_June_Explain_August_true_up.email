Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Great questions. Those payments were your owed accruals from May (XX) and June (XX). Our commissions system is back up and running on our end, and we're in the final stages of testing the reporting section of the partner portal. 

Once that's up, we'll run an audit of all partner accounts from the last year. Any missed commissions we find will be included in your August payment. 

Best,
Partner Support
