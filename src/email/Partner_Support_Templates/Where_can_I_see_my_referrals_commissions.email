Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Great questions. You can view your referral's current month activity on the Commission page in your partner portal, and your payment history on the Commission History page. All your referrals can be seen on your View All Stores page.
 
Keep in mind, we send commission payments the month following the accrual date (ex. we pay all partners in December for all November accruals). 
 
 
Best,
