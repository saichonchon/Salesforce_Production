    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},

I am sad to see you recently cancelled your BigCommerce service. As the Manager of Account Services, I would appreciate your feedback to understand why you cancelled your service and understand what we could have done better. Please take two minutes to answer our simple survey.

Take our survey now.

On behalf of your BigCommerce team, I thank you for your time.
