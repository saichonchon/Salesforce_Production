    <subject>Your BigCommerce Catalog Transfer: Congrats, it’s time to set up your store</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},

It’s official: we’ve completed the catalog transfer from your store to BigCommerce. Welcome to the family!

The catalog transfer is the first step in successfully re-launching your online business with BigCommerce. Now it’s time to get your business ready to sell!
Here are a few things to finalize before you launch:

- Organize your categories
- Add homepage text
- Add category descriptions/images (if needed)
- Set up store settings
- Set up shipping, taxes and payment gateways
- Place a test order
- Move over your domain
- Install an SSL certificate (optional)

If this feels overwhelming, don&apos;t fret. We have a team of Support Ninjas who can help guide you in setting up your store. To utilize this free service simply call 866-949-5336.

It has been great working with you. Good luck and happy selling!

Thanks,

The BigCommerce Team
