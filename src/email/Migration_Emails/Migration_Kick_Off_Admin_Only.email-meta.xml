    <subject>Your BigCommerce Catalog Transfer: We need your current store’s credentials to start</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},

Welcome to BigCommerce! We’re delighted you’ve chosen us to host your online store. You’re in good hands — we’ve successfully moved data for thousands of stores. With your help, the process can be quick and relatively painless.

Here’s what we need from you to get started:

Providing your current store’s credentials is essential to kick off the catalog transfer process. You can find your credential request form below. It’s simple, but we can’t begin your catalog transfer without it!

Thanks,

The BigCommerce Team
