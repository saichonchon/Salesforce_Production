    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},


We’ve been attempting to get in touch with you via email and over the phone.

We still haven’t received your current store’s credentials from you.

Unfortunately, we’re cancelling your data migration request so we can help other clients in our queue. If you paid a fee for this service, then expect a refund of your money into your account within 3-5 business days.


We’re so sorry it didn’t work out this time. If you’re still interested in having your store migrated to BigCommerce, please contact your sales agent and have them set up a new migration request.


Thanks,


The BigCommerce Team
