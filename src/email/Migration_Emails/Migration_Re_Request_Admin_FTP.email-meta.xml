    <subject>Your BigCommerce Catalog Transfer: We still need your current store’s credentials to start</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},

We haven&apos;t heard back from you with the credentials for your current store so we can get your catalog transfer under way.

Here’s what we need from you to get started:

Providing your current store’s credentials and FTP access credentials are essential to kick off the catalog transfer process. Please make sure this FTP user has access to the root directory of your store. You can find your credential request form below. It’s simple, but we can’t begin your catalog transfer without it!

Remember, we’re here to help. If you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to catalogtransfer@bigcommerce.com. We’re looking forward to working with you!

Thanks,

The BigCommerce Team
