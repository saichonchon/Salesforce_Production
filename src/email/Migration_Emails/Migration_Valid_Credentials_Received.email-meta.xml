    <subject>Your BigCommerce Catalog Transfer: We’ve started!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},

We’ve received your credentials and have assigned your catalog transfer to one of our dedicated technicians. Over the next 5-10 business days, we’ll carefully copy your data to a new BigCommerce store. When we feel confident, we’ll reach out and invite you to spot check our work and give the final stamp of approval before we move your store to the setup phase.

What should I do while I wait?

1) Check out our handy­dandy resource to answer to your burning questions:

If you can keep selling on your current store (spoiler: yes!)
What&apos;s included in your catalog transfer
What to expect during your catalog transfer
What you should be doing during your catalog transfer
How to get up and selling on BigCommerce

2) Get ready to open for business with BigCommerce. You&apos;ll want to gather items like login credentials, access codes and preferences for your current online store. Focus on gathering information around:

Which payment gateway fits your needs?
You current shipping provider
Your current tax settings
Need an SSL certificate?

Thanks,

The BigCommerce Team
