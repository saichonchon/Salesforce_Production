    <textOnly>Hi there,

We’ve received your credentials and have assigned your migration to one of our dedicated technicians. Over the next 10­-12 days, we’ll carefully copy your data to a new BigCommerce store. When we feel confident, we’ll reach out and invite you to spot check our work and give the final stamp of approval before we move your store to the setup phase.


What should I do while I wait?

2) Get ready to open for business with BigCommerce. You&apos;ll want to gather items like login credentials, access codes and preferences for your current online store. Focus on gathering information around:
