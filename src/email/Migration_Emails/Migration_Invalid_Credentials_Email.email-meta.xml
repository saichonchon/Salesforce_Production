    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Contact_First_Name__c},

We’re excited to get your catalog transfer started, but the credentials we received did not grant us access into your store.

{!Case.Invalid_Credentials_Detail__c}

Please reply to this email with the corrected information. If you are having trouble or have questions about the credentials for your current store, you may want to contact your current host.

Remember, we’re here to help. If you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to catalogtransfer@bigcommerce.com. We’re looking forward to working with you!

Thanks,

The BigCommerce Team
