    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.AppDeveloperContact__c},

Congratulations!



We’ve finished reviewing your application for the BigCommerce Technology Partner Program, and we’re happy to welcome you to the BigCommerce family.


Your new Partner User Name is {!Account.Partner_iDevID__c} and your Partner ID is {!Account.iDev_ID_Text__c}. You’ll need this to submit integrations on our Developer Portal. You should be receiving another email momentarily with your Partner Portal login details, plus some other theme-specific info that you can safely ignore. Please save both emails so you can quickly access this important information.


Now that you’ve been approved, you can open up a sandbox account to begin developing and testing your app integration. Just choose the “Create a Trial Store” option in the Partner Portal, and we’ll take it from there.


Once your app meets all of our App Store approval requirements, head over to the My Apps section of our Developer Portal to submit it for review.


Good luck, and we’ll see you soon!


The App Store Team</textOnly>
