    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Contact__c},



Thank you for submitting your app to BigCommerce!


From here, our team will test and review your app to verify it meets all of our App Store Approval Requirements. Please make sure that your app meets all of these requirements and is fully functional within your developer sandbox in the meantime.


We also require you to sign our Revenue Share Agreement before the app review process can begin. Please reply to this email with the name and email address of the appropriate person to handle this for your organization, and we’ll send the agreement via DocuSign.


Once we’ve received your signed contract, we’ll start reviewing your app.


If you’re an existing Partner, you may have already signed our Revenue Share Agreement. If so, please let us know (and include the full company name it was signed under) so that we can check our records.


We look forward to working with you,


The App Store Team</textOnly>
