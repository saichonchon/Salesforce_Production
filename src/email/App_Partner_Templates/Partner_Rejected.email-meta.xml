    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.AppDeveloperContact__c},

Thanks for applying to become a BigCommerce Technology Partner. Based on the details of your application, we are not interested in a partnership at this time.

Our developer ecosystem is constantly evolving, and weâ€™ll be sure to reach out to you in the future if changes to our platform make your integration more applicable to our platform.


Thanks again for your interest,


The App Store Team</textOnly>
