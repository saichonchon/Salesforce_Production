    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Contact__c},



After reviewing your app, we can’t approve it at this time.


Before submitting again, please make sure to review our App Store approval requirements and thoroughly test your draft app on your sandbox store.


Once you’ve rectified the the issue (quality, functionality, missing marketing materials or support contact info) you can resubmit on our Developer Portal.


If you have additional questions, please email our team at appstore@bigcommerce.com.



Thanks,


The App Store Team</textOnly>
