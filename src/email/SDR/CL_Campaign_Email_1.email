{!Opportunity.Contact_First_Name__c},

I left you a message earlier, so I’ll be brief. I’m contacting you because you spoke to a colleague of mine, and I wanted to restart the conversation. So far this year we’ve released new store themes and integrations that let you sell on Facebook and Pinterest. I'd like to see if there's anything we're doing that could benefit you. Reply to this email and I will send some details so you can quickly evaluate whether it would be worth your time.

Thank you,
