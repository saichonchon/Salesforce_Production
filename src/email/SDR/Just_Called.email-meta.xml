    <textOnly>Hey there {!Lead.FirstName},

I just tried to give you a call but it looks like I missed you. 

It&apos;s my understanding that you are the person to talk to when it comes to the Magento platform for the website.

Is email best to reach you or should I call at a different time?


Thanks,</textOnly>
