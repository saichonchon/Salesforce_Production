    <textOnly>Thanks for the introduction, {SDR name}. {Prospect name}, great to meet you! {SDR name} and I caught up and I am looking forward to our call. 

I like to use this first conversation to:
learn a bit about your business
gain an understanding of your goals for the next 6 to 12 months
hear why you&apos;re taking the time to talk with us
By the end of the call, weâ€™ll both be able to make an informed decision about next steps. As {SDR name} mentioned, if there is anything specific you&apos;d like to cover, just let me know.

Talk to you {Day of week}!</textOnly>
