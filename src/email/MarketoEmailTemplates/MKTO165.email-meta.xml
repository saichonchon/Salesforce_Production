    <subject>Fwd: See how one top merchant increased sales by 64%</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

Not sure if you saw this email. One of the best parts about working at Bigcommerce is hearing our merchants&apos; success stories, so I didn&apos;t want you to miss this case study about TwirlyGirl &lt;[[http://grow.bigcommerce.com/twirlygirl-case-study-pcf.html]]&gt;, who significantly increased their sales and revenue after moving to our platform. 

&quot;Year over year, our sales are up 64%. It&apos;s an amazing rate of growth, and we hope to continue that trend into the coming year. This growth would not have been possible on our old platform.&quot; â€” Cynthia Jamin, CDO 

Please call us &lt;[[tel:+18446328911]]&gt; if you have any questions about Bigcommerce.

Thanks, 

Paul Robinson
Director of Sales
