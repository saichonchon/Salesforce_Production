Omnichannel
 Retailers selling on two or more channels average twice the revenue of single-channel sellers. But until now, managing additional channels has meant dealing with multiple listings, overselling and data entry errors. In the next few months, BigCommerce is making it effortless to sell on Amazon and eBay, and enabling sellers to use Facebook checkout. No matter where a sale is made, it’s automatically synced to a single inventory to eliminate errors and overselling. Stay tuned as we roll out these updates.
