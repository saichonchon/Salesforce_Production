Access new customers through eBay — 8+ million unique visits per month
Recently, we announced the launch of an exciting new integration tool called eBay LINK, which makes it easier to sell your products on Australia’s largest marketplace, eBay, directly from your BigCommerce Store.

The eBay LINK Program has been designed to streamline the process of connecting your store to eBay.
How it works:





	- eBay LINK accesses your ecommerce store and gathers your product information such as images, descriptions and pricing
	- This information is then sent to eBay and listed in your branded eBay store
	- When a product is purchased on eBay, eBay LINK will send the order back to your ecommerce store to keep your inventory up to date
The benefits of selling on eBay are as follow:


 - Grow sales revenue by up to 50%*
 - Access new customers
 - Promote your products on the #1 ecommerce marketplace
 - Identify new products through eBay insights



This is great time to grow your listings and experience the convenience of selling on eBay, and as a special offer, we are giving new eBay customers the chance to get a free Feature Store on a 6 month trial, if you connect before 30 April 2016.**

To redeem this offer, please contact me directly at 02 8188 1832 &lt;[[tel:0281881832]]&gt; or simply reply to this email.
