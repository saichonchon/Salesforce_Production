A BigCommerce merchant turned crickets into a Shark Tank success

Many people thought it was crazy that Pat Crowley wanted to create a gourmet energy bar made from crickets.

Crowley originally funded his environmentally conscious product on Kickstarter and quickly set up an online store on BigCommerce. After seeing sales skyrocket, he went on Shark Tank to fund his company’s next step.

Mark Cuban invested $50,000 in Crowley’s “crazy idea”, allowing the company to ramp up production, distribution and promotion. Read our case study to see how Chapul has grown.
