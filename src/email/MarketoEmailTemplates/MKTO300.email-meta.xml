Announcement — BigCommerce raises $30 million in round of funding
BigCommerce has raised a $30 million round of funding led by GGV Capital &lt;[[http://www.ggvc.com/]]&gt;, a San Francisco-based investment firm that has also invested in innovative companies including Airbnb, Alibaba, Houzz, Pandora, Slack, Square and Zendesk. With this funding, managing partner at GGV Capital Jeff Richards joins the BigCommerce board. The round also included participation from all existing investors, including Stephan Schambach, founder and former chairman of Demandware.

“This new financing follows on the successful launch of several new products, our partnerships with major players in ecommerce like eBay and Square, and our successful expansion into the midmarket,” Brent Bellm, CEO of BigCommerce said.

Coming Soon — New partnership tiers, partner training, and more
As your partner, we’re here to help your business grow and succeed. In Q3, we’re introducing enhancements to the partner program that will improve the way you’re trained and the way you’re paid for referrals.

What’s changing? We’re introducing a new, tiered ecosystem, allowing you to make bigger commissions as you sell more and grow your BigCommerce practice. We’re also launching training classes that will help you sell more effectively and will be required for advancing in the Partner Program. Finally, we’re aligning marketing support and resources to help you grow your business.

Over the next couple of months, we’ll be sending out more specifics, so watch your email for more details.
Announcing Pinterest Buyable Pins to help customers sell more
We’re thrilled to introduce Pinterest Buyable Pins, a convenient feature that will help your customers sell even more on social media. Buyable Pins let Pinterest users find merchants’ products, learn more about them, and purchase them — all without ever leaving the Pinterest app. Buyable Pins &lt;[[https://business.pinterest.com/en/buyable-pins]]&gt; are just like regular pins, but feature a blue “Buy it” button, which enables Pinterest users to purchase merchants’ products directly through the Pinterest app. It’s a sleek, intuitive, and fast checkout experience that we know your customers (and theirs) will love.

Introducing new enhancements to our Shipping API
You asked for it, and we’re delivering. BigCommerce will now auto-detect the shipping provider for your customers’ orders based on the associated tracking number. This important feature upgrade will improve the end customer experience and ensure a clickable tracking link is provided. You do not need to make any changes to make use of this feature -- it will automatically roll out to all stores that have utilized the Order Shipments API endpoint.
