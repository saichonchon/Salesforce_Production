BigCommerce makes it easy for you to expand your reach and grow your sales  


Retailers selling on two or more channels average twice the revenue as single-channel sellers. We have developed our platform as a hub for selling on social channels like Facebook and Pinterest, in person with Square and soon through marketplaces like eBay.   
Online store:  Build a modern online store with a responsive design that looks and performs beautifully on desktops, laptops and mobile devices.

 Physical store:  Connect BigCommerce with the Square POS to have your inventory automatically updated whenever you make a sale, online or in person.

 Social media:  Shoppers can discover and buy your products on some of the world’s most popular social media platforms, including Facebook and Pinterest.

 Online marketplaces:  Get your products in front of millions of shoppers by listing on high-traffic marketplaces like Amazon and eBay.
