Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
Thanks for dropping by the BigCommerce booth at ShopTalk.
We’d love to tell you more about BigCommerce Enterprise &lt;[[http://grow.bigcommerce.com/Event-Demo-Request.html?utm_campaign=Prospects.Marketing Events.2015Q4.&amp;utm_source=shoptalk&amp;utm_medium=event&amp;utm_term=BigCommerceEnterprise&amp;utm_content=followup]]&gt;, which can help you increase sales, decrease costs and spend less time managing your technology. Thousands of successful businesses sell more with BigCommerce, including Berkey Water, Dorco, Dunning Sportswear, Martha Stewart Cafe, MetroPCS, Native Union, O’Boticario and Rock Bottom Golf.
According the market research firm Ipsos, same store sales for mid-market merchants on BigCommerce grew about twice as much as the ecommerce industry average.
Are you available for 15 minutes this week to discuss your business goals and how BigCommerce can help you reach them? Feel free to reply to this email or schedule time online.

Thanks,
The BigCommerce Team
