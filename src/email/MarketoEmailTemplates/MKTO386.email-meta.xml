Great seeing you in Chicago at IRCE
We were thrilled to interact with so many partners and merchants during the 2016 International Retailer Conference + Exhibition this month in Chicago. From our CEO’s speech “Curation + Comedy + Connection = Word of Mouth That Moves the Needle” to encounters on the trade show floor to our one-day “Best Practices in Ecommerce” workshop, we were able to trade advice, handshakes and laughs with many of you.

If you didn’t make it to this year’s event, make it a priority for 2017!

New Study: How to Find Success in Omni-Channel Sales


Ecommerce leaders like you know that consumer behavior has changed drastically over the last few years, with more people engaging in a combination of online and brick-and-mortar research and buying. But until now, it’s been difficult to find data on where, when and how consumers were using each sales channel or how merchants could best focus their resources when creating an omni-channel strategy for their brand.

To help partners and merchants better understand what makes a seamless and successful omni-channel experience, we conducted a survey in partnership with Kelton Global &lt;[[http://keltonglobal.com/]]&gt; of more than 1,000 nationally representative Americans 18 years and older who cited making an online purchase within the previous six months.

The results illuminate answers to omni-channel questions like:

 - Who shops online
 
- Where Americans spend online
 
- When Americans spend online
 
- What Americans are buying
 
- What influences the American shopper to purchase
 
- How Americans feel about online shopping
 
- How important is online shopping
 
- What this means for U.S. retailers


We think this data will prove highly valuable as you help your merchants build successful brands and omni-channel experiences.
