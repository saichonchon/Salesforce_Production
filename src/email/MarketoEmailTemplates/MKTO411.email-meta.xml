Introducing the BigCommerce Channel Manager
Adding new online sales channels can significantly boost your exposure and grow your revenue. But until now, managing additional channels has meant dealing with multiple listings, overselling and data entry errors.

The new BigCommerce Channel Manager makes selling on multiple channels effortless. Connect your store to social media and marketplaces with just a few clicks. No matter what channel a sale comes from, you can process, fulfill and track it from your BigCommerce dashboard.
Sell directly on Facebook and Pinterest

Channel Manager currently supports Facebook and Pinterest, and more channels will be coming later this year.
