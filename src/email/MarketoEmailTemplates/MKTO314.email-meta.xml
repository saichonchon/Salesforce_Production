“Of course, this is no ordinary bourbon. Pappy Van Winkle has become the most famous whiskey in America, a unicorn unseen on store shelves for years, untasted by the vast majority of humans, and sold for astronomical sums on the secondary market. Those 28 bottles have a retail value of around $3,000 and a secondary value of perhaps $20,000, depending on age.” — Esquire
