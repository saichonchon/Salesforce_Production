Get discovered with the Bigcommerce Partner Marketplace

We’re making it easier than ever for merchants to find you online. The new partner locator is a client-facing, faceted search tool within the Bigcommerce Partner Marketplace that includes your business overview, competency, specialization and contact information. Reserve your spot before March 22 to be listed on the new Partner Marketplace.

To be listed, update your Partner Marketplace profile via your Account Profile in the Bigcommerce Partner 
Portal under “Edit Partner Marketplace.” For more information, refer to the Partner Marketplace Guide &lt;[[http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpartners.bigcommerce.com%2FEnglish%2F%3FReturnUrl%3D%252fEnglish%252fSolutions%252fresources%252fmarketplace_guide.aspx%253fmkt_tok%253d3RkMMJWWfF9wsRokua7JZKXonjHpfsX%25252F6OwkXKWg38431UFwdcjKPmjr1YIGTMF0aPyQAgobGp5I5FEOQ7XYVqp0t6YOWA%25253D%25253D%26mkt_tok%3D3RkMMJWWfF9wsRokua7JZKXonjHpfsX%252F6OwkXKWg38431UFwdcjKPmjr1YIGTMF0aPyQAgobGp5I5FEOQ7XYVqp0t6YOWA%253D%253D&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7wiQ8Dwm5UXaOablhgyPpiKxBYw]]&gt; on the Partner Portal or contact partnersupport@bigcommerce.com.

Coming soon — Stencil CLI, developer framework and automatic upload
Fully responsive. Modern. Beautiful. We’re excited about the 67 new themes we launched for Stencil &lt;[[http://bigcommerce.com/new-themes]]&gt; and the upcoming public release of the developer framework.

The Stencil command line interface (CLI) will become widely available in the coming weeks for custom theme development purposes. With Stencil CLI, you can build a completely bespoke site or have access to our new free theme -- Cornerstone -- for modification and development.
Our product team is working quickly to enable automatic upload capabilities for custom themes on Stencil. If you are developing a custom Stencil theme on behalf of a client and you plan on launching that store before June 2016, please let us know by filling out this form &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j_ScHkGeNMFzDL23YgmXbdQtYyY3vOPnxFhKGEf0lmA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1]]&gt; or reach out to your account manager. Find more details on how you can use Stencil here &lt;[[http://stencil.bigcommerce.com/]]&gt;.
Price Intelligently calls Bigcommerce the best value for mid-market
Which platform should I use? It’s a big decision for your customers, even when they’re working with a Bigcommerce partner like you. Recently, the Price Intelligently blog conducted extensive research on platforms including Shopify, Magento, Demandware and Bigcommerce to compare price, value, targeted market (mid-market, SMB, etc.) and sales cycle.
The verdict? “Bigcommerce offers the best value and the superior commerce platform for mid-market businesses.” Read the comparison piece &lt;[[http://www.priceintelligently.com/blog/ecommerce-platform-pricing-bigcommerce-shopify-magento-demandware]]&gt;, then share it with your customers!
Bigcommerce&apos;s new brand is set to launch soon
Big changes are on the way for the Bigcommerce brand.  As Bigcommerce continues to disrupt the mid-market as the commerce platform of choice, it’s imperative that the company&apos;s brand visually represent this differentiation.  Watch your email for more information on how you can participate in the new brand launch.
