    <subject>A tip for making customers happier</subject>
    <textOnly>When your customers are happy, you’re happy. And nothing makes merchants happier than outpacing their competition.
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
When your customers are happy, you’re happy. And nothing makes merchants happier than outpacing their competition.

Market research firm Ipsos recently found that online stores built on BigCommerce grow up to 2x faster than other ecommerce stores. We’re thrilled the research supports what we already knew: if we give talented designers and devs like you the tools you need to create beautiful, custom ecommerce sites with great SEO and easy business-app integration, it will lead to amazing results.

When you’re ready to help your customers sell more, faster, just visit your partner portal to register your deal &lt;[[https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=partner]]&gt; and start a client trial store.
Happy Selling, 
The BigCommerce Partner Team</textOnly>
