Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
Join us for the Best Practices in Ecommerce Workshop &lt;[[http://grow.bigcommerce.com/BigCommerce-IRCE16-Ecommerce-Workshop.html]]&gt; hosted by BigCommerce in Chicago and sample Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon — one of the world’s most sought-after bourbons. 

“Of course, this is no ordinary bourbon. Pappy Van Winkle has become the most famous whiskey in America, a unicorn unseen on store shelves for years, untasted by the vast majority of humans, and sold for astronomical sums on the secondary market. Those 28 bottles have a retail value of around $3,000 and a secondary value of perhaps $20,000, depending on age.” — Esquire
