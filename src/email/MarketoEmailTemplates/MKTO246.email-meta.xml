Product Updates, Offers and Promotions




Faceted search limits expanded to 500 values

We’re pleased to announce an update to BigCommerce’s faceted search feature (also known as product filtering), which raises the former limit of 30 values per facet to 500 values, that helps  your merchants offer more detailed search options than ever before. To gain access to this feature, you or your clients will need to update the theme files as follows, depending on the theme being used:



 - Compatible Blueprint themes &lt;[[https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Product-Filtering-Settings#themes]]&gt; - Visit the Design section in the control panel, where you will see that an update is available. 


 - Custom Blueprint themes - Visit the Product Filtering Toolkit &lt;[[https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Product-Filtering-Settings#themes]]&gt; on our Dev Portal to see how you can add this feature to custom themes. 


 - Stencil themes - Currently this feature is not available in Stencil themes, but it is coming soon.

Product SKUs updated to enable direct editing of more properties
We’re excited to announce an update to product SKUs that enables direct editing of the following properties, eliminating the need to create a product rule to edit each one:



 - Price 


 - Weight 


 - Image 


 - Enabled 


 - Purchasing Disabled Message



This means one less step for your clients as they manage their online stores, and it brings BigCommerce’s SKU editing capabilities in line with other platforms like Shopify and Square. 

The release affects SKU-only rule creation, the SKU list, the SKU create / edit modal and the API. It’s backwards compatible, so existing customer data and API integrations can continue to operate without needing a migration. However, rules applying to SKUs only can no longer be created or edited in the control panel as those properties should now be edited on the SKU directly. When using the API you can still manage rules applying to SKUs only, but plan on migrating your code to use the SKU properties as we are deprecating and eventually removing the ability to do so (date TBD).
