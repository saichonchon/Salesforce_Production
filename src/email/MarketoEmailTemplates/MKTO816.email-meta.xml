A BigCommerce merchant turned crickets into a Shark Tank success

Many people thought it was crazy that Pat Crowley wanted to create a gourmet energy bar made from crickets.



Crowley originally funded his environmentally conscious product on Kickstarter and quickly set up an online store on BigCommerce. After seeing sales skyrocket, he went on Shark Tank to fund his company’s next step.

&quot;We chose BigCommerce as a platform that we could launch our store on and stay with as we grow.&quot;
