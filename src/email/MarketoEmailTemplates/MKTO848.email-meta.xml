Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
Last week, we hosted our September BigCommerce Town Hall.

During this month&apos;s conversation, BigCommerce CEO Brent Bellm, CPO Jimmy Duvall, and the Product Team shared important updates about:


 - Apple Pay
 - eBay Integration
 - Optimized single page checkout updates
 - Stencil theme platform updates
 - New functionality for &quot;View Products&quot;
 - Cart-level discounts updates


We&apos;ve posted the video in our Town Hall library in the Community. Simply log-in to the Community to see what you missed.

We&apos;ll be sending out the invitation to the October Town Hall soon. We hope to see you there!
Best, 
The BigCommerce Team
