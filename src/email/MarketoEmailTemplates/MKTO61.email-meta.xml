    <subject>Fwd: What should you expect from your ecommerce platform?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

One of the questions I get a lot from merchants is, &quot;What are the critical success factors for an ecommerce platform?&quot; It&apos;s nice to say that the Bigcommerce platform has a reliable 99.99% uptime and we provide an optional SLA.  

If you&apos;ve had the same question, please make sure to check out the free guide &lt;[[http://grow.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-site-stability-speed-and-performance-guide-pcf.html]]&gt; mentioned below. It has some great advice to help you make the best decision possible when you&apos;re ready to switch platforms.

Of course, I&apos;m always here to help, too. Just call &lt;[[tel:+18446328911]]&gt; or email me if you have questions.

Enjoy, 

Garrett Ozar
