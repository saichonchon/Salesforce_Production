Last chance to reactivate your BigCommerce partnership
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},



We’re still hoping for the opportunity to work with you once again to grow your merchant business. Our new and improved partner program &lt;[[https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/design-solution/]]&gt; offers more features, better payment structures and more partner support resources than ever before.



Our records show that you still have BigCommerce stores that could be earning commissions for you. If you re-apply for our program by June 15, 2016, you’ll still be eligible to apply for these commissions. Eligibility expires after June 15, 2016.



Contact our Partner Support Team &lt;[[mailto:partnersupport@bigcommerce.com]]&gt; before this time to reactivate your account, apply for backpay that’s accrued since you left, and grow your business with BigCommerce.





Sincerely,



The BigCommerce Partner Team</textOnly>
