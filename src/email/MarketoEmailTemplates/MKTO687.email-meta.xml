    <textOnly>We’ll be making improvements to your control panel starting the week of September 15.



Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},



We’ve made improvements to the BigCommerce control panel that you’ll see in the next few weeks. Here are the key changes:

 - The navigation is now on the left-hand side and stays with you as you go down the page, making it accessible without having to scroll back up.
 - The sub navigation is visible in each subsection, reducing the number of clicks when working on daily tasks.
 - We’ve added new product features like Channel Manager, which lets you seamlessly integrate your store with Facebook and Pinterest (Amazon and eBay coming soon).
 - You now have the option to change how quickly you’re logged out due to inactivity: choose from 15 minutes up to 2 hours.

The changes will start to appear the week of September 15th. You won’t have to do anything to upgrade — we’ll send you a message in your control panel when the update is complete.

Best,



Derrek Pearson

Senior Product Manager
