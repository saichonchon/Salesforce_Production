Can I participate if I sell items that Google Shopping doesn’t support?
Google Shopping prohibits certain items from being advertised, but does not block merchants entirely. That means you can still use Google Shopping to drive traffic by advertising shirts, hats and other non-prohibited items that you may sell.
