With recent updates to our community, we made it easier for you to find the answers, resources, and connections you need to help your business grow. We know that running a business can be hard — we don’t want it to be hard to get the support you need to be successful.
Join us and discover new features like:


	- Answers: Your place to ask specific questions about the BigCommerce platform, and receive the “best answers” from expert store owners and our partners. Answers is an invaluable tool for receiving quick, straightforward solutions.
	- Discussions: Discussion groups are dedicated areas to connect with your peers about the topics that are important to you. In Groups, you’ll have candid, real-time discussions, receive advice including best practices, share success stories, and grow — together.
	- Ideas: Ideas is your place to be heard. Whether you have an idea for product enhancements, improving our support offerings, or items you would just like to see more of, BigCommerce Ideas will empower you to suggest new product enhancements, vote, comment and interact directly with BigCommerce staff.
	- And more!
