Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},



We’re sorry to see you leave the BigCommerce Partner Program. Since you didn’t reactivate your BigCommerce partnership before June 15, 2016, we’ve removed you from our Partner Program.


Is our Affiliate Program a better fit for you? BigCommerce affiliates can earn commissions by promoting BigCommerce using a referral link, pre-made banners, emails and more. Apply for your Affiliate Membership &lt;[[https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/affiliates/]]&gt; to receive your referral link.


If you decide you want to re-engage as a Design and Solutions Partner in the future, you can always re-apply here &lt;[[https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/design-solution/]]&gt;.


We wish you all the best for continued success in ecommerce design!



Sincerely,


 The BigCommerce Partner Team</textOnly>
