    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}!
We’re delighted that you’ve chosen BigCommerce as your e-commerce platform and are excited to help you begin building your store. Here’s what to expect:

First Step: Moving your existing store
Great news - we’ve submitted your new client migrations request form! As part of your Gold Plan, our migrations team will help you get started by transferring existing:
Product data (name/title, SKU, descriptions, options, dimensions, images)
Category Data (name and title)
Customer Data (name, address, email, phone)
SEO Data (301 redirects for your home page, product pages and category pages)

Depending on the complexity of your store this process takes between twelve and twenty business days. Please don’t modify your product information during this part of the process to ensure all details of your store come across successfully!

Second Step: Start using BigCommerce!
You may login and start setting up your BigCommerce store (e.g. shipping, taxes, payment gateway), selecting your templates TODAY! But remember, please no modifying any product/category data in either your current store or the new BC store until the migration is complete.

Next Step: Verifying the migration
Once we’ve wrapped up your migration you’ll receive an email from our team requesting that you verify everything’s looking good and asking you to confirm that our work is done. Find issues? Just send us a list and we’ll get back to work.

Last Step: Customizing and launching your new store
Time for finishing touches! BigCommerce comes packed with new features and functionality you can use to boost your success. Our library of on-demand videos with tips and techniques make finishing store set-up easy. Get started on our Webinar page and attend one of our client BigCommerce Tours. When you’re done, just click launch!
