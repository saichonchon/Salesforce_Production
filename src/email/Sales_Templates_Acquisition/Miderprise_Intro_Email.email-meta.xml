    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I work with large volume e-commerce clients at BigCommerce and we have found that many business owners are in need of a more scalable and robust ecommerce platform. These business owners have come to us because our platform offers the functionality and features ideal for high-growth business with annual revenue between $500,000 and $30,000,000.

Our Enterprise Plan offers unlimited bandwidth and API calls, a dedicated account management team, priority support and includes a fully customizable, responsive design. Additionally, clients are enjoying a significant cost savings by moving to BigCommerce with many paying 30-50% less versus their existing e-commerce solution.

When would be a good time for us to schedule a call and discuss whether or not we would be a fit for your enterprise?

Best regards,</textOnly>
